# Onware Developer Candidate Challenge

Hi!

We love working at Onware. Part of what makes Onware a great place to work
is that we get to learn from our fellow developers and can depend on them
for quality work that helps the team acheive success. To keep Onware filled
with great developers, we've added this challenge to our interviewing process.

## Things to know

1. The challenge consists of some minor tasks to be completed on a toy app.
2. The challenge takes place using the GitHub codespaces feature. This means:
    * You won't have to set up anything on your machine. ðŸ¥³
    * You will need to sign up for a GitHub personal account (they are free).
    * GitHub provides all users with 60 hours of free codespaces usage a month,
      which is *way* more than needed for our challenge. If you've used up your
      codespaces for the month on your existing account, just create a new account.
3. As you work on the challenge, save your work to a public repository under
   your account.
4. You will share the link to your repository with us.
5. We will meet to talk about your challenge solutions, and also your prior experience.
